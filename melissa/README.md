#MELISSA

##USE 

* Melissa was self replicating virus that displayed an annoying message to the victim, multiples insntancies of the message could appear at the same time before achieving to delete the malware's binary, it is harmless to the target's system in general since it doesn't provoke damage to files, unless it is specificated to do so, it is not the case of this version.
* To run the program you must compile the .c file and the java class, and then in the terminal pass the parameters of the picture's path and the java class. e.g : ./key.out java VirusImage heretics.png  , these things are going to be changed in the future to run without the users specific execution.
