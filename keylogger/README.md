#KEYLOGGER

##USE

* An spyware virus used to capture the target's keyStrokes , two versions were implemented , one using java and other using C 

* Java versions used an special java library that is stored in the same directory than the .java file , it is neccesary to compile the.java using the flag -cp followed by the path o the .jar library location (as i said this one is in the same directory for simplicity) in the java compiler , e.g: " javac -cp jnativehook-2.1.0.jar keyVirus.java", it is not intended to run as a daemon process just yet.

* C version is easier to write than java version and it doesnt require additional libraries more than the ones already implemented in C , the malware only needs to be compile and be executed to work , the main difference with the java version is that it writes the victims keyStrokes in a .txt file that is intented to be send the one who send the virus. this program is intented to run as a daemon process.
